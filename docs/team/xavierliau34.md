## Project: BinBash

BinBash is a CLI-based **Inventory Management System** that is targeted at small retail business owners.
BinBash aims to make the inventory management process streamlined, error-free and highly efficient, through its
extensive suite of inventory management features.
BinBash also enables users to gain valuable insights into their inventory, through comprehensive profit reporting
features which facilitate efficient sales and trends analysis.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## Summary of Contributions

**New Feature:** Implemented `quote` command
- What it does: Provides a randomly generated quote upon input of the `quote` command.
- Justification: Enhances user experience by adding an entertaining and user-friendly feature.
- Highlights: The implementation generates quotes from a curated database and ensures random selection for variety.

**Implemented JUnit tests for several commands and parsers**

- What it does: Adds comprehensive test coverage, ensuring that the program behaves as expected under various scenarios and edge cases.
- Justification: Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the codebase. 
By adding JUnit tests, we enhance the robustness of the application and reduce the likelihood of introducing regressions in future changes. 
Increasing test coverage also helps identify and address potential bugs or issues, improving the overall quality of the application. 
Comprehensive testing is the ultimate aim.
- Highlights: The JUnit tests cover different aspects, including testing for adding single items, multiple items, 
item details correctness, handling duplicate item names, and handling zero quantity restocking, so on and so forth.
