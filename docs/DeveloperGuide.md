## Setting up, getting started

## Design

### Data Component

![DataComponent](/Users/yihaowong/Downloads/cs2113/tp/docs/images/DataComponent.png)

API: [`ItemList.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/binbash/ItemList.java)

The `Data` component is primarily composed of an `ItemList` object that stores different types of `Item`.

`Item` has different types, such as `RetailItem`, `OperationalItem`, `PerishableRetailItem`, and `PerishableOperationalItem`.

## Implementation


## Product scope

### Target user profile

{Describe the target user profile}

## User Stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|new user|see usage instructions|refer to them when I forget how to use the application|
|v2.0|user|find a to-do item by name|locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list|

## Non-Functional Requirements

{Give non-functional requirements}

## Glossary

* *glossary item* - Definition
