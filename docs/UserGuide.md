#### Possible Issues During Startup

Have problems loading up BinBash? Fret not, here's how to troubleshoot some of them:

1. **File is Corrupted Error**:<br>
   If you encounter an error that says the file is corrupted, you should first take a look at your `items.txt` file. It's possible that the content of the file has become invalid. Here's what you can do:
    - **Delete and Recreate**: If you're unsure about the formatting, simply delete the `items.txt` file. BinBash will create a new one when you restart the application.
    - **Rectify the Content**: If you have important data you can't lose, open the `items.txt` file and fix any formatting issues. Make sure each task follows the correct structure BinBash expects. Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) for more details on the expected save file format.

2. **Issues with Data Directory or File**:<br>
   If you encounter an error about not being able to create or read/write from the data directory or file, this usually means there's a permissions issue on your system. Here's how to handle it:
    - **Check Permissions**: Ensure that BinBash has the right permissions to access the folders it needs. Right-click on the directory and check its properties to make sure reading and writing are allowed.

3. **Unable to Access System Terminal**:<br>
   Ensure that you're using a recent version of your Operating System's Terminal application. For Windows, consider using Powershell or Terminal instead of Command Prompt.

## Key Definitions

### Item

An `Item` in BinBash represents an entity within your inventory system, which could be anything from products for sale 
to supplies for operations. Items are characterized by their attributes, which provide detailed information for 
inventory management.

BinBash categorizes items into **four** types, each with its attributes that facilitate proper inventory tracking. A 
brief description of the four item types is as follows:

1. `Retail Item`: These are items that are intended for sale to customers. Retail items typically include products that are stocked and sold for profit.
    - **Example**: A pair of sneakers up for sale.

2. `Operational Item`: These items are used by the store for its daily operations but are not sold to customers.
    - **Example**: An operational item could be a printer cartridge for a company printer.

3. `Perishable Retail Item`: These are retail items that have an expiry date and need to be sold before they spoil.
   This category is crucial for businesses dealing with food products or other perishable goods.
    - **Example**: A perishable retail item could be a carton of milk to be sold, which has an expiry date.

4. `Perishable Operational Item`: Similar to perishable retail items, these are operational items that have a limited shelf life.
    - **Example**: A bottle of disinfectant used to sanitize the office, with an expiry date.

Each of the four item types in BinBash may have various attributes, which provide important details for managing your 
inventory. Here are some attributes that may apply to the different item types:

- **Item name**: The unique identifier for the item.
- **Item description**: A narrative describing the item.
- **Item quantity**: How many units of the item are currently in stock.
- **Sale price**: The price at which the item will be sold to customers.
- **Cost price**: The price at which the item was purchased by the store.
- **Threshold**: A number indicating the minimum stock level before a restock is needed.
- **Expiry date**: The date when a perishable item should be sold or used before it spoils.

For all item types, BinBash uses the item name as a primary identifier. It is important to use distinct names for 
different items.

Restrictions for the different attributes can be found in the [Placeholders](#placeholders) section, or within the 
specific feature in the [Features](#features) section.

### Flags

Flags are delimiters in BinBash that enable the system to distinguish different parameters without ambiguity. 
You would enter the corresponding [Placeholder](#placeholders) immediately after each flag.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Note:</strong>
<li>Only one item type flag can be specified for each item. This means that you can only use either <code>-re</code> or <code>-op</code> but not both at the same time. </li> 
<li>The <code>-e</code> flag should be provided if the item that you are adding is a Perishable item. That is to say, it will expire by the provided expiry date.</li>
<li>The <code>-s</code> flag should be provided if the item that you are adding is a Retail item. This means that this item is meant to be sold.</li>
<li>The flags can be placed in any order. There is no specific order that you have to abide by.</li>
<li>Words in <code>UPPER_CASE</code> are the arguments that are meant to be supplied by you.<br>For example, in <code>-n ITEM_NAME</code>, <code>ITEM_NAME</code> would represent the name of the item you are adding (e.g., <code>add -n apple</code>).</li>
<li>For some commands, if flags and arguments are wrapped in square brackets, they are optional.<br>For example, <code>add [-q ITEM_QUANTITY]</code> signify that the <code>-q</code> flag, as well as its argument, are optional for the command.</li>

### Command Format

You will encounter BinBash commands throughout this User Guide. Before you delve into the different commands in the 
Features section, let's first learn what a command consists of.

Here is an example: <br>
![Command Format Diagram](images/UG_CommandFormat.png)

A command consists of:

1. **Command Word**: Tells BinBash what action you wish to execute.
2. **Flags**: Distinguishes between inputs. A flag is usually followed by a placeholder.
3. **Placeholders**: Represents data that you wish to input. Replace this with valid data. Using the example in the 
image above, `ITEM_NAME` in `-n ITEM_NAME` can be replaced with `-n Potato`.

Now that you understand the command structure of BinBash, you're ready to learn about the different commands available, 
and how they can be of use to your business!

## Features

This section shares with you on the different features available in BinBash. Before continuing, ensure you have read the
section on [Flags](#flags) and [Placeholders](#placeholders). 

Each feature in BinBash can be implemented through the use of a command, and for each of the commands, you may expect 
the following:
- A description of the command
- The format of the command
- The expected behavior of the command
- A few valid examples of the command, together with their explanations.
- Important points to note

However, if you've read the previous sections and are starting to feel confused about the use of flags and placeholders in 
achieving your inventory needs, don't worry! Continue reading to know more about BinBash's Command auto-suggestions 
feature that can help you out. It's like having a little helper right at your fingertips!

### Command auto-suggestions

BinBash's command suggestion feature can be activated by pressing the `tab` key which either:
1. Suggests a lists of all valid options on first press; then cycles through this list on subsequent presses; or
2. Autocompletes the command if only 1 valid option is found
Each suggestion is accompanied by a brief description.

To use this feature on command flags, type `-` before pressing `tab`.
As before, each flag is accompanied by an explanation.

To exit command suggestion mode simply press any other key.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> This feature is particularly handy when first learning to use BinBash. Starting from a blank input, press tab to see every command.<br>
Likewise within each command, type <code>-</code> followed by <code>TAB</code> to give a quick overview of all possible options.
</div>

### Adding an item: `add`

> This allows you to add a new item to start keeping track of in your inventory.

#### Adding a Retail item

Format: `add -re -n ITEM_NAME -d ITEM_DESCRIPTION -s SALE_PRICE -c COST_PRICE [-q ITEM_QUANTITY] [-t THRESHOLD]`

* `-re` specifies that this is a Retail item.
* `ITEM_NAME`, `ITEM_DESCRIPTION`, `SALE_PRICE` and `COST_PRICE` must be specified.

<div id="infoCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ec1cf;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #eef9fc;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>ITEM_NAME</code> field must be unique for each item in your inventory. If you wish to add different batches of the same item with different expiry dates, consider naming them with a suffix, e.g., <code>Milo_1</code>, <code>Milo_2</code>.
</div>

* All other fields are optional.
* If `ITEM_QUANTITY` is not specified, a default value of `0` will be assigned to it.
This allows you to create a placeholder for an item in your inventory you've yet to receive any stock of.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Once you've received stock of the item, you can call the <a href="#restocking-an-item-restock"><code>restock</code></a> command to increase the stocked quantity of the item.
</div>

* If `THRESHOLD` is not specified, a default value of `1` will be assigned to it.
* There is no need to include the currency. A `$` sign will be appended to the prices.
* Retail items do not have an `EXPIRY_DATE` field, hence the flag `-e` is not used.

Examples:

- `add -re -n lego -d toys -q 350 -s 102.00 -c 34.32 -t 50`<br>
   ```text
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Noted! I have added the following item into your inventory:
    
   [R] lego
       description: toys
       quantity: 350
       cost price: $34.32
       sale price: $102.00
       threshold: 50
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   ```
- `add -re -n hammer -d tools -q 20 -s 9.00 -c 4.39 -t 10`<br>
   ```text
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Noted! I have added the following item into your inventory:

       cost price: $4.39
       sale price: $9.00
       threshold: 10
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

#### Adding a Perishable Retail item

Format: `add -re -n ITEM_NAME -d ITEM_DESCRIPTION -e EXPIRY_DATE -s SALE_PRICE -c COST_PRICE [-q ITEM_QUANTITY] [-t THRESHOLD]`

* The command to add a Perishable Retail item is similar to adding a Retail item.
* An additional flag , `-e`, is used here to include the `EXPIRY_DATE`, hence signifying a Perishable Retail item.

<div id="infoCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ec1cf;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #eef9fc;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that the provided date is in <code>DD-MM-YYYY</code> format. For example, <strong>20 January 2024</strong> is represented as <code>20-01-2024</code>.
</div>

Examples:

- `add -re -n apple -d fruit -q 50 -e 12-12-2024 -s 1.00 -c 0.39 -t 10`<br>
   ```text
   -------------------------------------------------------------

       threshold: 1
       expiry date: 02-11-2024
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

#### Adding an Operational item

Format: `add -op -n ITEM_NAME -d ITEM_DESCRIPTION -c COST_PRICE [-q ITEM_QUANTITY] [-t THRESHOLD]`

* `-op` specifies that this is an Operational Item.
* `ITEM_NAME`, `ITEM_DESCRIPTION` and `COST_PRICE` must be specified.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Once you've received stock of the item, you can call the <a href="#restocking-an-item-restock"><code>restock</code></a> command to increase the stocked quantity of the item.
</div>

* All other fields are optional.
* If `ITEM_QUANTITY` is not specified, a default value of `0` will be assigned to it.
This allows you to create a placeholder for an item in your inventory you've yet to receive any stock of.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Once you've received stock of the item, you can call the <a href="#restocking-an-item-restock"><code>restock</code></a> command to increase the stocked quantity of the item.
</div>

* If `THRESHOLD` is not specified, a default value of `1` will be assigned to it.
* There is no need to include the currency. A `$` sign will be appended to the prices.
* `-s` and `-e` are not used as there are no `SALE_PRICE` and `EXPIRY_DATE` fields for an Operational Item.

Examples:

- `add -op -n light bulbs -d lighting -q 5 -c 2.30 -t 3`<br>
   ```text
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Noted! I have added the following item into your inventory:
    
   [O] light bulbs
       description: lighting
       quantity: 5
       cost price: $2.30
       threshold: 3
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   ```

#### Adding a Perishable Operational item

Format: `add -op -n ITEM_NAME -d ITEM_DESCRIPTION -e EXPIRY_DATE -c COST_PRICE [-q ITEM_QUANTITY] [-t THRESHOLD]`

* The command to add a Perishable Operational item is similar to adding an Operational item.
* An additional flag , `-e`, is used here to include the `EXPIRY_DATE`, hence signifying a Perishable Operational item.

<div id="infoCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ec1cf;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #eef9fc;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that the provided date is in <code>DD-MM-YYYY</code> format. For example, <strong>20 January 2024</strong> is represented as <code>20-01-2024</code>.
</div>

* `-s` is not used as there is no `SALE_PRICE` for a Perishable Operational Item.

Examples:

- `add -op -n milk -d to make coffee -q 2 -e 03-10-2024 -c 1.30`<br>
   ```text
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Noted! I have added the following item into your inventory:
    
   [P][O] milk
       description: to make coffee
       quantity: 2

### Searching for an item: `search`

> This allows you to search for items in your inventory, filtering results through a number of item-specific fields.

Format: `search -n NAME_QUERY -d DESCRIPTION_QUERY -q QUANTITY_RANGE -c COST_PRICE_RANGE -s SALE_PRICE_RANGE -e EXPIRY_DATE_RANGE -l NUMBER_OF_RESULTS`

- At least one of `-n`, `-d`, `-q`, `-c`, `-s`, or `-e` must be set.
- `NAME_QUERY` and `DESCRIPTION_QUERY` perform a case-insensitive search on the name and description fields of inventory items respectively.
- `RANGE` searches take the form `{min_value}..{max_value}` and are inclusive of the minimum or maximum values specified.
  - At least one of `min_value` or `max_value` is required.
  - Omitting `min_value` searches for everything up to and including the `max_value`.
  - Omitting `max_value` searches for everything with at least `min_value`.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong><br> For example, to search for items with a quantity up to and including 20, we should format our query as:<br>
<code>-q ..20</code>.<br>
To search for items that cost at least $15, we should format our query as:<br>
<code>-c 15..</code>.
</div>

- `EXPIRY_DATE_RANGE` is similar to the above range arguments: except dates need to be specified in the format `dd-MM-YYYY`.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí°<strong>Tip:</strong><br> For example, to search for items with an expiry date between 20 January 2024 and 30 January 2024, we should format our query as:<br>
<code>-e 20-01-2024..30-01-2024</code>.
</div>

- Shows the first `NUMBER_OF_RESULTS` results if set, else all matching results are shown.

**Examples:**

- `search -n snake plant`
  Will return all items with names containing **snake plant**, such as "snake plant" and "snake plant seeds".
- `search -l 6 -c ..5`
  Will return the first 6 items that cost up to and including $5.00.
- `search -s 20..30`
  Will return all items with sale prices between $20 and $30 (inclusive).
- `search -l 1 -e 11-11-2023.. -d seeds`
  Will return the first item expiring on or after 11 November 2023 and that contain the word "seeds" in its description.
- `search -q 50.. -e 17-09-2023..23-11-2023`
  Will return all items with current quantity at or above 50 and that expire between 17 September 2023 and 23 November 2023 (inclusive).

### Listing current inventory: `list`

> This allows you to list out all items that you have in your inventory list. 
> You can also use this command to display your inventory list, sorted based on cost price, sale price, profit, or expiry date.

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> Indexes of the items listed, whether in a sorted list or unsorted list, can be used as references for <code>delete</code> and <code>update</code> commands.
</div>

#### List Inventory (Unsorted)

View the inventory in the order items were added:

Format: `list`

#### List Inventory (Sorted)

BinBash also allows you to sort your inventory in ascending order based on different criteria. This means that items 
with the lowest 'values' will be showed first, whilst items with the highest 'values' will be showed last. The different
'values' that BinBash can sort by can be seen below:

| Flag | Description                                |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
| `-c` | Sort by cost price                         |
| `-s` | Sort by sale price                         |
| `-p` | Sort by profit                             |
| `-e` | Sort by expiry date (for perishable items) |

Format: `list -FLAG`

Example: 

Suppose you have the following items in your inventory:
- Item A (Perishable Retail), Cost Price: $5, Sale Price: $15, Expiry Date: 01-05-2023
- Item B (Perishable Retail), Cost Price: $10, Sale Price: $12, Expiry Date: 15-04-2023
- Item C (Perishable Operational), Cost Price: $3, Expiry Date: 10-07-2023
- Item D (Non-perishable Retail), Cost Price: $7, Sale Price: $14

Using `list -c`, BinBash sorts all items by cost price in ascending order:
- Item C, Cost Price: $3
- Item A, Cost Price: $5
- Item D, Cost Price: $7
- Item B, Cost Price: $10

Using `list -e`, BinBash sorts the items in order of which items will expire first. Notice how BinBash will filter out 
non-perishable items (Item D) and sort the remaining items by their expiry date:
- Item B, Expiry Date: 15-04-2023
- Item A, Expiry Date: 01-05-2023
- Item C, Expiry Date: 10-07-2023

Similarly, you can use `list -s` to sort the items by sale price and `list -p` to sort by profit. Once again, 
note that for sorting the items by sale price and by profit, operational items like Item C will not appear in these 
sorted lists as they do not have a sale price.

<br>

### Selling an item: `sell`

> This allows you to decrement the quantity of an item after it has been sold.

#### Selling an item using item name

Format: `sell -n ITEM_NAME -q ITEM_QUANTITY`

* Both flags `-n` and `-q` are mandatory.
* The flag `-n` is used, meaning that the `item name` is used as an identifier to identify the item you wish to sell.
* The quantity given to this command represents the amount of item that you want to sell. This amount will be reduced
  from the existing quantity of the item in the inventory list.

Examples: 

- `sell -n oranges -q 20` This will deduct the quantity of "oranges" in your inventory list by 20.
- `sell -n lego bricks -q 219` This will deduct the quantity of "lego bricks" in your inventory list by 219.

#### Selling an item using item index

Format: `sell -i ITEM_INDEX -q ITEM_QUANTITY`

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> To determine the <code>index</code> of an item in your inventory, call the <code>list</code> command first, and note down the number displayed next to your item of interest.
</div>

* Both flags `-i` and `-q` are mandatory.
* The flag `-i` is used, meaning that the `item index` is used as an identifier to identify the item you wish to sell.

Examples:
- `sell -i 1 -q 50` This will decrease the quantity of the item at index 1 in your inventory list by 50.
- `sell -i 3 -q 35` This will decrease the quantity of the item at index 3 in your inventory list by 35.

<div id="infoCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ec1cf;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #eef9fc;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Note:</strong><br> 
<li>Only one item identifier flag, <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code>, can be used with the <code>sell</code> command to identify the item that you want to sell.</li>
<li>There must be a minimum of one flag used, excluding the <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code> flag.</li>
</div>

<br>

### Restocking an item: `restock`

> This allows you to increment the quantity of an item after it has been restocked.

#### Restocking an item using item name

Format: `restock -n ITEM_NAME -q ITEM_QUANTITY`

* Both flags `-n` and `-q` are mandatory.
* The flag `-n` is used, meaning that the `item name` is used as an identifier to identify the item you wish to restock.
* The quantity given to this command represents the amount of item that you want to restock. This amount will be added
  to the existing quantity of the item in the inventory list.

Examples:

- `restock -n apples -q 50` This will add the quantity of "apples" in your inventory list by 50. .

#### Restocking an item using item index

Format: `restock -i ITEM_INDEX -q ITEM_QUANTITY`

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> To determine the <code>index</code> of an item in your inventory, call the <code>list</code> command first, and note down the number displayed next to your item of interest.
</div>

* Both flags `-i` and `-q` are mandatory.
* The flag `-i` is used, meaning that the `item index` is used as an identifier to identify the item you wish to update.

Examples:
- `restock -i 2 -q 10` This will add the quantity of the item at index 2 in your inventory list by 10.

<div id="infoCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ec1cf;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #eef9fc;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Note:</strong><br> 
<li>Only one item identifier flag, <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code>, can be used with the <code>restock</code> command to identify the item that you want to sell.</li>
<li>There must be a minimum of one flag used, excluding the <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code> flag.</li>
</div>

### Updating an item: `update`

> This command allows you to modify the details of an existing item in the inventory. You can identify the item that you want to update, by
> specifying the name of the object, or its index number as displayed in the inventory list.

#### Updating an item using item name

Format: `update -n ITEM_NAME [-d ITEM_DESCRIPTION] [-q ITEM_QUANTITY] [-e EXPIRY_DATE] [-s SALE_PRICE] [-c COST_PRICE]
[-t THRESHOLD]`

* The flag `-n` is used, meaning that the `item name` is used as an identifier to identify the item you wish to update.
This flag is required.
* Using the `item name` identifier will only update the first occurring item in the list should there be any duplicates.
* All other flags are optional, depending on what details you wish to update.

Examples:
- `update -n banana -d ripe fruit -q 30 -e 10-10-2024 -c 0.50`
Updates the description of the item named "banana" to "ripe fruit", its quantity to 30, its expiry date to 10 October 
2024 and its cost price to $0.50. Other information remain unchanged.
- `update -n "printer paper" -s 15.00 -t 5`
Updates the sale price of the item named "printer paper" to $15.00 and its threshold to 5.
- `update -n "chicken sandwich" -q 50 -e 01-01-2025 -t 10`
Updates the quantity of the item named "chicken sandwich" to 50, its expiry date to 1 January 2025 and its threshold 
to 10.

 
#### Updating an item using item index

Format: `update -i ITEM_INDEX [-d ITEM_DESCRIPTION] [-q ITEM_QUANTITY] [-e EXPIRY_DATE] [-s SALE_PRICE] [-c COST_PRICE]
[-t THRESHOLD]`

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> To determine the <code>index</code> of an item in your inventory, call the <code>list</code> command first, and note down the number displayed next to your item of interest.
</div>

* The flag `-i` is used, meaning that the `item index` is used as an identifier to identify the item you wish to update.
* To know the `item index`, we encourage you to first use the command `list` to find out the index of your item of 
interest.
* All other flags are optional,depending on what details you wish to update.

Examples:
- `update -i 2 -d "office supplies" -s 20.00`
Updates the description of the item at index 2 to "office supplies" and its sale price to $20.00. Other information 
remains unchanged.
- `update -i 4 -q 10 -c 2.00 -t 2`
Updates the quantity of the item at index 4 to 10, its cost price to $2.00, and its threshold to 2.


<div id="infoCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ec1cf;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #eef9fc;">
‚ÑπÔ∏è <strong>Note:</strong><br> 
<li>Only one item identifier flag, <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code>, can be used with the <code>update</code> command to identify the item that you want to sell.</li>
<li>There must be a minimum of one flag used, excluding the <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code> flag.</li>
</div>

### Deleting an item: `delete`

> This lets you delete an item from the inventory. You can identify an item by its name, or its index number (as displayed in the inventory list).

#### Deleting an item using item index

Format: `delete -i ITEM_INDEX`

<div id="tipCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #9ee09e;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #e6f5e6;">
üí° <strong>Tip:</strong> To determine the <code>index</code> of an item in your inventory, call the <code>list</code> command first, and note down the number displayed next to your item of interest.
</div>

* `ITEM_INDEX` must be specified.
* `ITEM_INDEX` specified must exist in the inventory, otherwise no item will be deleted.
* Index of items can be viewed using the `list` command.

Examples:
- `list` followed by`delete -i 1` Deletes the item with index of 1.

#### Deleting an item using item name

Format: `delete -n ITEM_NAME`

* `ITEM_NAME` must be specified.
* `ITEM_NAME` specified must be the exact name of the item.
* `ITEM_NAME` is case-sensitive. Capital letters are treated differently from lower case letters, e.g "apple" is different from "APPLE"
* If there are no items with item names matching `ITEM_NAME`, no items will be deleted.
* If there are items with the same `ITEM_NAME`, only the first instance of item with `ITEM_NAME` will be deleted.
* Item names of items in the inventory can be viewed using the `list` command.

Examples:
- `list` followed by `delete -n cookie` Deletes the first item named "cookie".

<div id="warningCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #feb144;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #fff8e6;">
‚ùó <strong>Warning:</strong> Item name is case-sensitive. So items with names as "COOKIE", "Cookie", etc.  will not be deleted.
</div>

- `list` followed `delete -n tissue paper` Deletes the first item named "tissue paper".

<div id="warningCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #feb144;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #fff8e6;">

### Saving and Loading data

Unsure as to how you can save your BinBash data? Don't worry! Your data is automatically saved to your local storage. No manual saving of data is required.

Similarly, your saved data will be automatically loaded into BinBash when you start the application. If no previous save data was found, the application starts on a clean state.

<div id="warningCallout" style="padding: 1em; border: 0 solid #feb144;border-left-width: 4px;border-radius: 6px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; padding: 1em; border-radius: 4px; color: #293132; background-color: #fff8e6;">

For advanced users, BinBash data is stored locally as a <code>.txt</code> file in your BinBash install location:
<br><code>< Location of binbash.jar >/data/items.txt</code>.
<br><br>
Do exercise caution when directly editing this file, as BinBash <strong>will not load</strong> corrupted data (i.e., data that is not formatted correctly). 
<br>
We highly recommended that you take a backup of your save file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I know if I have Java `11` installed on my computer? <br>
**A**: Using the terminal/command prompt, type in `java -version`. If Java `11` is installed, you should see a result that is similar to this:
```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.22" 2024-01-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment ... (build ...)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM ... (build ...)
```
If not, refer to Oracle's [guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) on installing Java `11` for your operating system.

**Q**: Can I move my BinBash data to another computer? <br>
**A**: Absolutely! Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can do this:
1. On your current computer, locate the BinBash save file. The save file can be found at `<Location of binbash.jar>/data/items.txt`. Make a copy of this file.
2. Ensure that BinBash has been installed on the other computer. Refer to [this section](#getting-started) for more details.
3. On the other computer, create the `/data` folder in the BinBash install location if it does not exist.
4. Then, paste the copied save file in this folder. If an existing save file already exists, choose to overwrite it.
5. Start up BinBash, and execute the [`list` command](#listing-current-inventory-list) to check that your data has been loaded successfully.

**Q**: Do I need an Internet connection to use BinBash? <br>
**A**: You do not need an Internet connection. BinBash can be used offline.

**Q**: I want to modify my `items.txt` file. How should I format my items?<br>
**A**: Firstly, we recommend that you take a backup of your current `items.txt` file before editing it.

Then, open the file in any text editor of your choice (you can use `Notepad` on Windows). Feel free to add, modify or remove rows, but do ensure that they adhere to this format:
```text
ITEM_TYPE|ITEM_NAME|ITEM_DESCRIPTION|QUANTITY|ITEM_COST_PRICE|TOTAL_UNITS_PURCHASED|ITEM_THRESHOLD|ITEM_EXPIRATION_DATE|ITEM_SALE_PRICE|TOTAL_UNITS_SOLD|
```

If your item does not contain a certain attribute (e.g, no `ITEM_SALE_PRICE`), replace its value with a whitespace.

## Glossary

### Bash
A computer program that provides a text-based interface and environment for user input. Also, the name of a programming language commonly used for scripting and operating system job control.

### Command Prompt / Command Line / Terminal
A means of interacting with a computer through keyboard typed lines of text, also known as commands. This is in contrast to the currently more popular graphical user interface (GUI), which uses visual elements that users can directly manipulate to perform their desired actions.

### Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
